CSCI-4710 Final Project Idea

	Our group is interested in implementing an image macro (meme) 
	generation web application. For clarification, an image macro 
	is an image with text superimposed on top of it, usually with 
	a top and bottom row of text. Image macros may also be 
	comprised of a few images called panels.  Our motivation for 
	this project stems from a want to more completely understand 
	how a web application like this would work. We’re familiar 
	with static web pages, and manipulation of the DOM tree with 
	JavaScript, but building this application would allow us to 
	further investigate how information is handled within a web 
	application, as well as how image manipulation could be 
	handled within the same application.

	Our planned application would provide a web space where users
	could select and modify templates or upload and modify new
	images.  Users would also be able to insert text within our
	user interface and select where they’d like the text to 
	appear. In that way,  our web application would rid the 
	user of the need to install and learn to use image editing
	software as well as the need to find original copies of
	popular meme images.  The application would also allow 
	the user to download the image to their local storage device.
